  <h1>Meet a11y.css</h1>

  <p>Pronounced “Alix”. Because it's fun.</p>

  <p>This <a href="">CSS file</a> intends to warn developers about possible risks and mistakes that exist in <abbr>HTML</abbr> code. It can also be used to roughly evaluate a site's quality by simply including it as an external stylesheet.</p>

  <p></p>

  <p style="font-weight: bold;">If you want to get involved in this project, be sure to take a look at its wiki. I'll be pleased to read your issues or pull requests!</p>

  <p id="3">Note that this bookmarklet might take a couple of seconds to load since it basically injects the a11y.css stylesheet within the DOM of the page you're browsing. It might be a bit slow at first because it is being downloaded from GitHub, but it's the price to pay to keep it up-to-date.</p>
